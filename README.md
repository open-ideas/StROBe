# StROBe


Currently in beta.

**StROBe** (Stochastic Residential Occupancy Behaviour) is an open web tool developed at the [KU Leuven Building Physics Section](http://bwk.kuleuven.be/bwf/) to model the pervasive space for residential integrated district energy assessment simulations in the
[**openIDEAS**](https://github.com/open-ideas) modeling environment (among others). Primarily conceived as a tool for scientific researchers, **StROBe** aims at providing missing boundary conditions in integrated district energy assessment simulations related to human behavior, such as the use of appliances and lighting, space heating settings and domestic hot water redrawals.
**StROBe** is also highly customizable and extensible, accepting model changes or extensions defined by users. 


## Dependencies

**StROBe** is implemented in **Python 2.7** and uses the packages *os*, *numpy*, *random*, *time*, *datetime*, *calendar*, *cPickle*, *itertools*, and *jason*, which are all generally available.

## Examples

In [example.py](https://github.com/open-ideas/StROBe/blob/master/example.py) you can find simple examples for:  
- simulation of individual households using `class Household()` from [Corpus/residential.py](https://github.com/open-ideas/StROBe/blob/master/Corpus/residential.py), and 
- simulation of sets of households as inputs for **IDEAS** using `class IDEAS_Feeder()` from [Corpus/feeder.py](https://github.com/open-ideas/StROBe/blob/master/Corpus/feeder.py).

## Revision history

**Apr 27, 2020**
(See [pull request](https://github.com/open-ideas/StROBe/pull/28) for details.)

- Added option to save output files generated by [`Corpus/feeder.py`](https://github.com/open-ideas/StROBe/blob/master/Corpus/feeder.py) for temperature set-points in K (default) instead of Celsius. In this way these outputs will be consistent with the **StROBe** input readers in **IDEAS**. See also [related thread](https://github.com/open-ideas/IDEAS/pull/1127) in **IDEAS**. 

**Mar 9, 2020**
(See [pull request](https://github.com/open-ideas/StROBe/pull/26) for details.)

- Fixed problem of appliances being used independently by more than one occupant at a time, which was generating higher loads. Note that this can influence the total electricity demand, which is not verified in any way.

**Mar 9, 2020**
(See [pull request](https://github.com/open-ideas/StROBe/pull/25) for details.)

- Changed delay times of cycle loads in [`Data/Appliances.py`](https://github.com/open-ideas/StROBe/blob/master/Data/Appliances.py) such that the specified annual demand and number of cycles are obtained on average, instead of fixing the number of cycles and delay only (which lead to high annual demand).


**Feb 13, 2020**
(See [pull request](https://github.com/open-ideas/StROBe/pull/21) for details.)

- Added extra rules for cold appliances ownership such there is always at least one fridge and not more than two freezers. Note that this can influence the total electricity demand, which is not verified in any way.


**Feb 4, 2020**
(See [pull request](https://github.com/open-ideas/StROBe/pull/20) for details.)

- Changed [`Corpus/feeder.py`](https://github.com/open-ideas/StROBe/blob/master/Corpus/feeder.py) output function to only load pickled household files once for all outputted variables. This reduces outputting time, while keeping the same outputs and file formats. 


**Jul 18, 2019**
(See [pull request](https://github.com/open-ideas/StROBe/pull/18) for details.)

- Fixed cycling loads implementation to account for cycle length, as before the power was only applied for one minute. 


**Jun 15, 2018**
(See [pull request](https://github.com/open-ideas/StROBe/pull/14) for details.)

- Added a minimal working example to simulate a single household and a group of buildings (feeder). See [`example.py`](https://github.com/open-ideas/StROBe/blob/master/example.py)


**Jul 3, 2018**
(See [pull request](https://github.com/open-ideas/StROBe/pull/12) for details.)

- Fixed problem in lighting adjustment.
- Fixed standby-use of appliances and DHW, which was only included one time-step before the appliance/water use is turned on.


**Jun 15, 2018**
(See [pull request](https://github.com/open-ideas/StROBe/pull/11) for details.)

- Fixed problem in activity probabilities in `class DTMC` in [`Corpus/stats.py`](https://github.com/open-ideas/StROBe/pull/11/files#diff-766109a870ede664c022e3f24738863d), where Sunday was used twice instead of Saturday.

**Jun 15, 2018**
(See [pull request](https://github.com/open-ideas/StROBe/pull/10) for details.)

- Brought last 4 h of resulting time series to the front so that data starts at midnight instead of 4am (which is when the survey statistics begin). This is applied in the `roundUp()` function of [`Corpus/residential.py`](https://github.com/open-ideas/StROBe/blob/63da1fc06db9ebe683a69b879436104f1ffdfa11/Corpus/residential.py#L572-L581).
- Updated [`Corpus/__calibrate__.py`](https://github.com/open-ideas/StROBe/blob/master/Corpus/__calibrate__.py) file to perform automatically the calibration of `cal` values of appliances, and added check for annual electricity load.

**Sep 28, 2017**
(See [pull request](https://github.com/open-ideas/StROBe/pull/7) for details.)

- Fixed space heating type definition that previously produced many unheated household profiles.

**Apr 20, 2017** 
(See [pull request](https://github.com/open-ideas/StROBe/pull/4) for details.)

- Added a function to generate several scenarios of demands for the same household and period: [`Corpus/simulation.py`](https://github.com/open-ideas/StROBe/blob/master/Corpus/simulation.py).
- Fixed the generation of lighting loads, that was on when asleep or away.
- Fixed the selection of appliances, which selected only less probable devices.
- Updated paths, data importation and initialization files.
